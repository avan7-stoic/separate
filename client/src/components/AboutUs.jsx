                    At Inua Wasichana, we believe that access to menstrual hygiene products should not be a barrier to education.
                    Our platform is designed to address the high rates of school absenteeism among girls in Sub-Saharan Africa due
                    to a lack of sanitary supplies. We aim to create sustainable support for these girls by enabling regular
                    donations to charities focused on menstrual hygiene and related needs.

                <p className="paragraph">
                    In many Sub-Saharan countries, girls from disadvantaged backgrounds miss up to 20% of their school days due
                    to the lack of access to sanitary towels. For primary school students, this can mean up to 18 weeks of missed
                    classes out of 108, and for high school students, nearly 24 weeks out of 144. This gap not only affects their
                    academic progress but also limits their future opportunities.
