This repository focuses on addressing the issue of menstrual hygiene management for school-going girls in Sub-Saharan Africa. The goal is to create a platform that facilitates regular donations to charities dedicated to providing sanitary supplies.

## Overview

In many Sub-Saharan countries, school-going girls struggle to access essential sanitary supplies, leading to significant school absenteeism. This project aims to automate the donation process, enabling users to set up regular donations to support charities focused on menstrual hygiene and related needs.

## Problem Statement

Studies have shown that girls from poor families miss up to 20% of school days due to lack of sanitary towels. This results in lost educational opportunities, with girls in primary school missing up to 18 weeks and those in high school missing nearly 24 weeks of learning. Organizations are working to address these issues by providing not just sanitary towels but also clean water and sanitation facilities.

## Solution

We aim to create a platform that enables users to:
- Donate regularly to selected charities.
- Set up automated donations (e.g., monthly, annually).
- Choose to be anonymous or not.
- Receive reminders to donate.
- Access stories about the beneficiaries of their donations.
