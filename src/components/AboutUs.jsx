                        At <strong>Inua Wasichana</strong>, we believe that access to menstrual
                        hygiene products should not be a barrier to education. Our platform
                        is designed to address the high rates of school absenteeism among
                        girls in Sub-Saharan Africa due to a lack of sanitary supplies. We aim
                        to create sustainable support for these girls by enabling regular
                        donations to charities focused on menstrual hygiene and related
                        needs.

                    <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
                        In many Sub-Saharan countries, girls from disadvantaged backgrounds
                        miss up to <strong>20% of their school days</strong> due to the lack
                        of access to sanitary towels. For primary school students, this can
                        mean up to <strong>18 weeks</strong> of missed classes out of 108,
                        and for high school students, nearly <strong>24 weeks</strong> out of
                        144. This gap not only affects their academic progress but also
                        limits their future opportunities.
